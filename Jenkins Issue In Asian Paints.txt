- Sumit - I am facing an issue while pushing the change to the master branch, master branch is protected?
	- Go to Schemes-Portal-2 Repositry Setting and expand the expand the protected branch And check if its protected or not.
- In repoistry We don't have any option to create a new branch in this repo, can you help out in this?
	-  Firstly check the permission then assign the permission to mainter to push the code.
- gitignore binary excepted in jenkins
	- Add The Bracket in condition in Package Stage.
	
	[ Gitlab Issue ]

- If anybody faces issue with gitlab
Check we need to do:

1. Ask them to login in https://gitlab.asianpaints.com/.
If they are able to login. ie there credentials are working fine

Ask them to run below commands.
git config --global user.name --> it should give you P00XXX id.

git config --global user.email --> we should get asianpaints ID.

We can check with them if they have changed their passwords recently.

In Credential manager we create generic credential under window.

URL: https://gitlab.asianpaints.com/.
Username: P00XXXXX
Password: Windows passwords

2. If they are unable to login in https://gitlab.asianpaints.com/.

If the employee is old. Check if the P00XXX is active or Blocked in admin area.

-Hi 

The issue is resolved. It was because of Java path only. We have redirected it to /usr/bin/ and now the deployment is success.

- Sure, there are a few Fortify APIs that you can use to get the count of vulnerabilities.

GET /api/v3/releases/{releaseId}/vulnerabilities This API call will return the number of vulnerabilities found in the application version with the specified release ID.
GET /api/v3/projects/{projectId}/vulnerabilities This API call will return the number of vulnerabilities found in all of the application versions in the specified project.
GET /api/v3/findings This API call will return the number of all findings, including vulnerabilities, in all of the projects in your account.

To use these APIs, you will need to have an API token. You can get your API token from the Settings page in your Fortify account.

- GET /api/v3/releases/{releaseId}/vulnerabilities?severity=CRITICAL,HIGH
