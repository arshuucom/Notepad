--------------------Scheme Reconfiguration Ansible Script------------------------------
Hi Pavithra, below are the current deployment steps we follow , please verify and let us know in case of any change.

Deleting files from the application server
Download package from Nexus
making backup of config and custom folder
unzip files that we downloaded from nexus
searching file for delete files in delete.txt
stopping the server
Deploy content (custom and Config) from package
execute ant clean all command / execute ant all command
starting the server
Get files in a logs folder and verify by checking the "Server startup" in logs
---------------------------------------

* sanity report parth : cd /tmp

Explore the sanity script in test jenkins and check the script how it works, and explore the execute_santity_report.sh in this script we are getting
the report And in this we are adding the colours script.

* JIRA

	- Usage of component features in Jira workflow.	
	Platform - Hybris ------> We can say Hybris is a Backend for Ecommerce Application. [Hybris Commece] is Platform ICM for test jenkins
	Application - B2B, B2C, etc
	Change request - Each aplication have multiple change request. Users can come and create a CR.
	
	If application is enabled the devops enabled should be YES.
	A single application can have a different component. We can define that, if we have to deployment android based we can add android as component.
	
	
	- Connectivity between Jira and Jenkins
	As i explore the connectivity between jira and jenkins are done, and in configure system i have gone through the JIRA steps like Connection timeout and the JIRA url.


Shall we try to do the UAT deployment only through ansible by bypassing jenkins

-----------------Aniket Task------------
- File Read one by one using shell script
