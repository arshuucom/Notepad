[QUESTION]

1.INSTALL NTP CLIENT AND CHRONY.
- hostnamectl
- ip address : to check the ip.
- ping: to check 
- vim /etc/hosts : to edit the file
- 192.168.220.200 serverb.lab.example.com : add a entry in it.
- vim /etc/chrony.conf : open file for chrony service
- comment line that starts with pool
- below that add line : add servername according to the question. eg:- server rhel9svr.example.com iburst
- chrony sources -v : to check wheather its added or not.

2.BUILD CONTAINER IMAGE FROM URL HTTP:22323232332 NAME WATCHER

3.LDAP

4.shell script to find the size from 50m the user arshad with gid and uid and store in root/lines
	- find / -user arshad -type f -size +50M -printf "%s %g %u\n" > /lines

	-find / -user arhaan -type f -size +50c -exec stat -c "File with size 50 bytes found: %n (GID: %g, UID: %u)" {} \; > /root/PractiseRHCSA/new

5.CONTAINER CREATE FROM IMAGE WATCHER AND NAME AND CREATE SYSTEMD SERVICE AND STORE LOGS.

6. CREATE LOGICAL VOULUME NAME DATABASE AND VOULUME GROUP NAMED BACKUP AND FILESYSTEM FSAT.

7. SWAP PARTITION OF 512MIB .

8. TAR FILE FOR BZIP2

9.CONFIGURE THE NTP  CONFIGURE YOUR SYSTEM SO THAT IT IS AN NTP CLIENT OF CLASSROOM.EXAMPLE.COM : https://github.com/chlebik/rhcsa-practice-questions/blob/master/questions/023_configure_ntp_on_the_client.md

10.THEY WILL ASK US TO CREATE AN CONTAINER IMAGE NAMED SOME XYZ

11.AND THEY WILL ASK US CONTAINER  SERVICES CONFIGURATIONS

12.CONFIGURE AUTOFS TO AUTOMOUNT THE HOME DIRECTORIES OF PRODUCTION5 DOMAIN USERS. NOTE THE FOLLOWING: 
SERVERA.LAB.EXAMPLE.COM (172.25.250.10) NFS -EXPORTS /USER-HOMES TO YOUR SYSTEM.
REMOTEUSER15 HOME DIRECTORY IS NODE1.LAB.EXAMPLE.COM:/USER-HOMES/REMOTEUSER15
REMOTEUSER15 HOME DIRECTORY SHOULD BE AUTOMOUNTED LOCALLY MAPPED TO /RUSER IN YOUR SYSTEM  
HOME DIRECTORIES MUST BE WRITABLE BY THEIR USERS. 
WHILE YOU ARE ABLE TO LOG IN AS ANY OF THE USERS PRODUCTION1 THROUGH PRODUCTION30, THE ONLY HOME DIRECTORY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE FROM YOUR SYSTEM IS PRODUCTION5.

12.A]Configure autofs to automount the home directories of LDAP users as follows: host.domain11.example.com NFS-exports /home to your system.
This filesystem contains a pre-configured home directory for the user ldapuser11 ldapuser11's home directory is host.domain11.example.com /rhome/ldapuser11 ldapuser11's home directory should be automounted locally beneath /rhome as /rhome/ldapuser11
Home directories must be writable by their users
ldapuser11's password is 'password'.

vim /etc/auto.master /rhome /etc/auto.misc
:wq!
# vim /etc/auto.misc
ldapuser11 --rw,sync host.domain11.example.com:/rhome/ldpauser11 :wq!
#service autofs restart
service autofs reload
chkconfig autofs on
su -ldapuser11
Login ldapuser with home directory
# exit

[IMPORTANT QUESTION]
13. BUILD A CONTAINER AS USER STUDENT
USING THE URL(HTTPS://XYZ.COM) TO BUILD THE CONTAINER IMAGE WITH NAME MONITOR. 
DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTAINER FILE 


14.CONFIGURE THE CONTAINER AS A SYSTEM START-UP SERVICE AND MOUNT VOLUMES PERSISTENTLY  
CREATE THE CONTAINER NAME AS ASCII2PDF AS STUDENT USER
RUN THE CONTAINER BY USING IMAGE MONITOR WHICH ONE WAS ALREADY DONE IN PREVIOUS 
CREATE THE CONTAINER AS A SYSTEM START-UP SERVICE, WHILE REBOOT IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY START THE SERVICE WITHOUT ANY HUMAN INTERVENTION. 
THE SYSTEM SERVICE SHOULD BE CONTAINER-ASCII2PDF. 
THE LOCAL DIRECTORY /OPT/FILES SHOULD BE PERSISTENTLY MOUNT ON CONTAINER’S /OPT/INCOMING DIRECTORY. 
THE LOCAL DIRECTORY /OPT/PROCESSED SHOULD BE PERSISTENTLY MOUNT ON CONTAINER’S /OPT/OUTCOMING DIRECTORY. 
IN WORKING OF SERVICE STARTS, ANY FILE CREATE/STORE UNDER THE /OPT/FILES AUTOMATICALLY CREATES INTO PDF ON /OPT/OUTCOMING DIRECTORY.

*CREATE A REPOSITORY FILE   HTTP://CONTENT/RHEL9.0/X86_64/DVD/APPSTREAM   HTTP://CONTENT/RHEL9.0/X86_64/DVD/BASEOS
 
*CREATE A SWAP PARTITION 512MB SIZE. 
 
*CREATE ONE LOGICAL VOLUME NAMED DATABASE AND IT SHOULD BE ON DATASTORE VOLUME GROUP WITH SIZE 50 EXTENT AND ASSIGN THE FILESYSTEM AS EXT3. 
(I) THE DATASTORE VOLUME GROUP EXTENT SHOULD BE 16MIB. (II)MOUNT THE LOGICAL VOLUME UNDER MOUNT POINT /MNT/DATABASE. 
 
*RESIZE THE LOGICAL VOLUME SIZE OF 100 EXTENT ON /MNT/DATABASE DIRECTORY. 

*SET THE RECOMMEND TUNED PROFILE FOR YOUR SYSTEM. 

*RESIZE THE GIVEN LOGICAL VOLUME TO 300MIB OR IN BETWEEN THE RANGE 240 TO 330.
