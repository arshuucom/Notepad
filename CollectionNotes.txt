*Which of the following statements is *NOT* a benefit of deploying the IBM Event Streams Operator versus open-source Apache Kafka?*
-Apache Kafka has many distinct components to deploy, configure, and coordinate for secure connectivity.
-Secured network ingress traffic.
-Container placement critical to ensure production-level availability.
-*Highly skilled experts to monitor and manage deployment.

*How would you describe IBM MQ's guarantee once-and-only-once delivery to a client?
-IBM MQ provides a gateway to help secure, control and log messaging traffic and interactions, and supporting containers while maintaining system performance. This is what guarantees once only delivery. 
-IBM MQ allows clients to create, expose, manage, and monetize APIs across clouds. This means businesses and their customers can connect digital applications so that messages are delivered only-and-only-once.
-*Referred to as asynchronous messaging, IBM MQ is the "shock absorber" between applications. The sender application does not need the receiving application to be available at the same time, as IBM MQ provides queue availability to support guaranteed once-and-only-once.
-With IBM MQ, clients can build integration flows in minutes starting with a catalog of connectors. These connectors have a MQ queue between them. The IBM MQ checks to make sure the messages are sent and received once-and-only-once. 

*You are discussing the following with your client. 'When a source application has no knowledge of who is listening to the events being emitted, or when a source application is normally completely disconnected from the target application’ what messaging pillar are you discussing?

-Microservices and Cloud Native application development
-Hight Speed Data Transfer

Wrong*Which statement best describes the difference between IBM MQ Managed File Transfer (MFT) capabilities and IBM Aspera?
-IBM MQ Managed File Transfer is for transferring files over long distances at speed while IBM Aspera is best for short distance transfer of very large volumes of data.
-*IBM MQ Managed File Transfer is only to be used for files up to 100KB and Aspera is for all message sizes including image and video data.
-2***IBM MQ MFT is a better fit for regional transfer use cases while IBM Aspera focuses on moving very large files quickly over longer distances.
-IBM MQ Managed File Transfer uses IBM Aspera under the covers so there is no real difference between the two solutions.

*A client is discussing how difficult it is to offer its customers a more personalized experience. Which client persona are you speaking with, and are they a Buyer or an Influencer?
-*The client is a Line of Business persona and is a Buyer.
-The client is a Line of Business persona and is a Influencer.
-The client is a Enterprise Architect persona and is a Buyer.
-The client is Developer persona and is a Buyer.
