	1..ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: No JSON object could be decoded



Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  could not find expected ':'

The error appears to be in '/root/ansibleAutomation/useCase.yml': line 14, column 1, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:
 

Solution: Syntax is not allign proper in the task module..




2..The offending line appears to be:

      FILE="/root/Demo.txt"
    if [[ -e "${FILE}" ]]; then
    ^ here

Issue: In shell script module the yaml file is not written proper.
